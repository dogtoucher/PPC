## Importance of parallelism

- Moore's law
- the number of trasistors grows exponentially

## Performance of computers

Before 2000

1. The *clock speed* of the CPU increased

2. CPUs were using fewer and fewer clock cycles per operation

After 2000

1. The number of transistors kept increasing

2. The *clock speed* stopped improving (2-3 GHz)

## New kind of performance

Keypoints:

1. Latency: the time to perform an operation from start to finish

2. Throughput: the number of operations completed per time unit


How to reach a much higher throughput?

Parallelization patterns

## How to exploit parallelism?

Good performance -> Parallelism -> Independent operations in practice
